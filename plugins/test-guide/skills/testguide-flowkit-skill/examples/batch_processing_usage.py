"""BatchProcessing is a FlowBlock that applies a defined flow to each item of an input list/batch.

The BatchProcessing block returns a list containing the out_block results for the flow runs of all items of the
input list.

In order to use the BatchProcessing block a flow and an out_block need to be specified. The specification for both
elements in described in more detail below:
- flow: Flow is the sub-flow which is run one time for every item of the parameter "list" of the
           BatchProcessing block. The inner blocks of this sub-flow need to be defined the same way as overall
           flows of the flow-kit are defined.

- out_block: The out_block defines the block from which the result values are taken for the output of the
             BatchProcessing block. It must be a block contained in the sub-flow given by the flow defined
             in the constructor of BatchProcessing.

Connection of the parameters in the defined sub-flow with the flow containing this block:
Values from the containing flow you want to use in the flow contained in the BatchProcessing block need to be
passed as parameters into the BatchProcessing block. There are two ways values can be passed into the contained
flow of a BatchProcessing block:
- Parameter LIST: This parameter takes a list of items. The sub-flow of the BatchProcessing block is run one time
                  for every item of this list. The specific item for the run can be assigned to parameters of the
                  contained flow by assigning it with "Assign('<name>').to_batch_item()" .
- User-defined flow parameters: User-defined flow parameters are values whose values are available in all
                                   runs of the sub-flow inside the BatchProcessing block. Any number of
                                   user-defined flow parameters can be used for a BatchProcessing block.
                                   User-defined flow parameters are defined by assigning a value to a parameter
                                   with a user-defined name for the flow parameter on the instance of the
                                   BatchProcessing, e.g. Assign('<my_defined_parameter>').to_block_result(...).
